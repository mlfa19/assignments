        "*   When we use Na&iuml;ve Bayes, it's beneficial to use \"smoothing\" to avoid the problems that arise because our model can run into problems (probabilities of 0, or values of negative infinity) when a word shows up in our test set that was not in our training set.\n",
        "*   In English (and most other languages), word order matters (\"people eat\" is different than \"eat people\"). Therefore, it's often useful to included some information about word order in our model. If we include complete information about word order (e.g., this word showed up 100 words before that word), our model would require extreme amounts of memory. We can typically get a way with a little information about word order, such as with bigrams, which are just pairs of words.\n",
        "*   We can use bigrams (or other ngrams) in various applications in natural language processing including text classification, sequence prediction, word generation, spell checking. These applications also extend beyond actual words or letters, and these techniques can really be applied to any sequences of items (e.g. series of coin flips).  \n",

The 25,000 review labeled training set does not include any of the same movies as the 25,000 review test set.

            "Original text:  Of all the kung-fu films made through the 70's and 80's this is one that has developed a real cult following. With the exception of all the films Bruce Lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story. An aging kung-fu master tells his last pupil Yang Tieh (Sheng Chiang) about five pupils he has trained in the past. All five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently. Their specialty in kung-fu is the name they have adopted like Lizard, Snake, Centipede, Toad and Scorpion. The master called them the Poison Clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants Tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil. An old man who was once a member of the Poison Clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target. Tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are. Tieh has discovered that the Snake is Hung Wen Tung (Pai Wei) and along with Tang Sen Kue (Feng Lu) who is the Centipede they kill a family to find the map. A map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the Scorpion but know one knows who he is. A local policeman named Ho Yung Sin (Philip Kwok) investigates the murders along with his partner Ma Chow (Chien Sun). Sin has a friend called Li Ho (Meng Lo) who is the Toad and they do know of each others identity. The Snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on Li Ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed. When Sin finds out he teams up with Tieh and together they go to combat Tung and Kue. <br /><br />This film was directed by Cheh Chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films. Chang was not your run of the mill kung-fu director and his films always had a special quality to them. While most martial arts films deal with revenge Chang did not use that as a central theme. Even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that. Five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks. Then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is. Very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of Changs stories were in a class all by themselves. I wouldn't exactly put it in the same league as \\Enter The Dragon\\\" because Bruce Lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking. This film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn't necessarily about fight scenes. Its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved. That alone makes this different from all the other kung-fu films. Very well made with a unique story.\"\n",

I'm afraid the answer to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it. Anyone under 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multi-layered, multi-themed beauty or not care about it. This film could convert anyone who avoids A/A as mindless violence.

The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex, his Czech handler.<br /><br />Never have the machinery behind a spy, and/or traitor, been told better! After having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor. His ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into 'a perfect spy', as his Czech handler calls him. <br /><br />And, by following his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path, once you've veered off it. He trundles on, even if he never get anything economic out of it, except promotion by his MI5 spy masters. Everyone's happy, as long as the flow of faked information continues! <br /><br />Magnus's father, played wonderfully by Ray McAnally, is a no-good con-man, who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money. In later years it is his son who has to bail him out, again and again. But by the example set by his dad and uncle, who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison, and his mom is sent off to an asylum, Magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving, not telling the truth. At first he overdoes it a bit, but quickly learn to tell the right lies, and to be constant, not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad.<br /><br />His Czech handler Alex, expertly played by Rüdiger Weigang, creates, with the help of Magnus, a network of non-existing informants, which supplies the British MI5 with fake information for years, and years, just as the British did with the German spies that were active in the UK before and during the war - they kept on sending fake information to Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned, liquidated or simply been replaced by MI5 men.<br /><br />The young lads who play Magnus in younger years does it wonderfully, and most of them are more charismatic than the older, little more cynic, and tired, Pym, played by Egan. But you buy the difference easily, as that is often the way we change through life, from enthusiasm to sorrow, or indifference.<br /><br />Indeed well worth the money!\n",

            "of all the kung fu films made through the 70 s and 80 s this is one that has developed a real cult following with the exception of all the films bruce lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story an aging kung fu master tells his last pupil yang tieh sheng chiang about five pupils he has trained in the past all five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently their specialty in kung fu is the name they have adopted like lizard snake centipede toad and scorpion the master called them the poison clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil an old man who was once a member of the poison clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are tieh has discovered that the snake is hung wen tung pai wei and along with tang sen kue feng lu who is the centipede they kill a family to find the map a map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the scorpion but know one knows who he is a local policeman named ho yung sin philip kwok investigates the murders along with his partner ma chow chien sun sin has a friend called li ho meng lo who is the toad and they do know of each others identity the snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on li ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed when sin finds out he teams up with tieh and together they go to combat tung and kue this film was directed by cheh chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films chang was not your run of the mill kung fu director and his films always had a special quality to them while most martial arts films deal with revenge chang did not use that as a central theme even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of changs stories were in a class all by themselves i wouldn t exactly put it in the same league as enter the dragon because bruce lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking this film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn t necessarily about fight scenes its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved that alone makes this different from all the other kung fu films very well made with a unique story \n",
            "it was simple and yet so nice i think the whole sense of sex segregation in society which can be bitter was shown very delicately it had a bitter kind of hummer in it the fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the movie more tangible and more realistic there was a documentary side to the movie too the best scenes were those that all the girls banned from watching were listening passionately to the soldier who is supposed to keep an eye on them broadcasting the game if you are an iranian the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won fills you up with national pride if you are not iranian you ll still love it all the same \n",
            "a friend of mine bought this film for 1 and even then it was grossly overpriced despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of hot girls adam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the ship s resident comedian the shamelessly named dickie due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender is presumed lost at sea sandler s character shecker gets his big break dickie is not dead he s rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea sick perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time \n",
